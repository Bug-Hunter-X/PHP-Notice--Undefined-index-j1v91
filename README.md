# PHP Notice: Undefined index

This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: the "Undefined index" notice.  This occurs when trying to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist.  The example shows the error and provides safer alternatives using `array_key_exists()` and the null coalescing operator (`??`).
